# NekoEssentialsFabric

NekoEssentialsFabric is a foundational server-side mod designed specifically for the NekoCraft Minecraft server. It aims to enhance the server experience by incorporating both essential functionalities found in popular mods like Essentials and Nucleus, and unique features tailored exclusively for the NekoCraft community.

## Features

- **Core Essentials**: Includes basic but crucial server management tools and utilities that improve gameplay for all players.
- **NekoCraft Specials**: Introduces custom features developed with NekoCraft's specific needs and community preferences in mind, enhancing the uniqueness of the server.

## Build

To build the project from source, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gradlew jar
```

This will compile the source code and generate a .jar file that can be deployed on the NekoCraft server.

## Installation

~~Ensure you have Fabric installed on your server.
Download the latest release of NekoEssentialsFabric from the Releases page.
Place the downloaded .jar file into the mods folder of your server.
Restart your server to apply the changes.~~

Since we currently have no plans to make this plugin non-exclusive, we will not provide installation instructions at this time.
